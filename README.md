## Reflection

This is the mini-project built while learning JavaScript concepts. 
The technologies implemented in this project are HTML, CSS and Javascript.
The new thing I learnt is how to use setTimer/setInterval functionality which I needed to highlight computer choice for the duration of 1sec.
